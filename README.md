# Stock-Predictor
The code downloads historical stock data for Apple using a specified date range, saves the data as a CSV file, and then prepares the data for a simple machine learning model. It extracts only the 'Close' price and scales these values with a MinMaxScaler. The first few rows of the dataset are printed to give an overview of the data. Next, it converts the date index into numerical values (using factorization) to create features, while the 'Close' prices serve as the target variable. The dataset is then split into training and testing sets. A Linear Regression model is trained on the training data, makes predictions on the test set, and the performance of the model is evaluated by calculating and printing the root mean squared error (RMSE).
